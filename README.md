# Weather-Wizard
Using a weather api to get weather predictions for multiple cities. Information is gathered so the user can plan trips. I used two different apis to get information. Had to take the information from the first api to get the second api to function. Used bootstrap to assist with making the html and css. To get the apis to function, I used fetch() .then() to acquire the data. My knowledge of scopes was tested and it caused me to have some issues. Once i got passed that, I used the push function to get the data where I needed it and sent it to the prefered locations. I used ids to replace already stated text content.
